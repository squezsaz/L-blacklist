# L-blacklist


## L-Blacklist – Advanced GUI Blacklist Plugin

**L-Blacklist** is a powerful blacklist management plugin with full **AdvancedBan support**, designed for modern Paper/Spigot servers.

When a player is added to the blacklist, the plugin automatically bans them using **AdvancedBan** (if installed) or vanilla commands.
Removing a player from the blacklist will also unban them automatically.

An **unban guard** blocks common unban commands, ensuring blacklisted players can never be unbanned manually.
OP players are protected and cannot be added to the blacklist.

All GUI texts, messages, and sounds are fully customizable, with built-in **English & Turkish** language support.

* `/blacklist` – Open the blacklist GUI
